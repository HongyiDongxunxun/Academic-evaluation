  "1Introduction": {
    "context1": "Due to academic information overload，it has become more dificult for scholars to retrieve useful information in academia. Xia et al.[ summarized the management，analysis methods，and applications of big scholarly data systematically，which pointing out that academia information overload has restricted the effectiveness of data mining. Many scholars have designed various methods to mine valuable information from big scholarly data. Abundant phenomenon as well as research patterns are discovered to improve scientific activities such as teamwork and recommender system.Among them，“serendipity”has been found to be potentially help with scientific progress.Serendipitycontains complex but valuable implications with its particular characteristics. Many distinguished scientific cases may be attributed to serendipity.For instance，recommender systems appear to help researchers assssing the relevant information quickly. However，scholars are not satisfied with the relevance or accuracy of the recommendations.In this circumstance，serendipity has been taken into consideration when designing recommender systems[2]. Serendipitous recommendations may surprise users and satisfy them well for broadening their horizons，which is implied in the process of scientific research.",
    "context2": "Nevertheless，researchers are not aware of the significance of serendipity，thus not much atention are paid to the element of serendipity. Thus this survey aims to help junior as wellas fellow scholars in understanding serendipity in science. Serendipity contains multi-dimensional concepts involving unexpectedness，novelty，and diversity.The definitions of the term serendipity as wellas its components are not unified.Its concept is firstly introduced from each dimension objectively and extensively.",
    "context3": "Many researchers have defined and investigated serendipity and its specific peculiarities in different context with respect to the original meaning of serendipity[3-7l.The term serendipity is firstly coined by Horace Walpole in the fairy story entitled“The Three Princes of Serendip”[8]. The three princes were always making fortunate discoveries in their wandering adventure，and the accidental but valuable discoveries indicate serendipity during the adventure. However，the term“serendipity”was used rarely until the 19th century when it was used for assessing the accidental or unplaced discoveries in sciencel9]. Since then，the term has gained an increasing recognition and became prominent with scope familiarity. Oxford Dictionary defines serendipity as“the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way”，while Merriam-Webster defines the term as“the faculty or phenomenon offinding valuable or agreeable things not sought for\".According to the free dictionary，serendipity is defined as“the faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident\". Cook[3] discussed that serendipity is closely related toa chance，which may lead to surprising results，and appropriate strategic decisions promote or stimulate serendipity. McCay-Peet et al.6]defined serendipity as “an unexpected experience prompted by an individual's valuable interaction with ideas,information,objects，or phenomena\".",
    "context4": "Jugovac et al.[10] proposed a recommender system that recommendations with serendipity are unusual and surprising.It is considered to be diffcult for researchers to investigate the concept of serendipity because it contains an emotional dimension as well Also,the serendipitous encounters in daily life are very rare.The factors that stimulate the emergence of serendipity are indistinct，and the design of serendipity measurement is also a challenging task. Besides，serendipity is determined by a robust subjective sense，which makes it dificult to give a consensus and agreed-upon definition.",
    "context5": "Serendipity in the context of information-seeking and retrieval has also been widely studied by researchers, which involves encountering useful and unexpected information[1l.Maccatrozzo et al.[]provided a theoretical description of serendipity aiming to help researchers in understanding the general idea of serendipity and its usage. To strengthen their theory，they conducted an empirical study by interviewing 28 interdisciplinary researchers, and proposed a model that gives insights into understanding serendipity based on serendipitous experiences. Moreover，their serendipity model mixes the factors of unexpectedness with insight，which provides valuable outcomes. Grange et al.[13] investigated serendipity under the scenario of online shopping based on the elements of unexpectedness and informational value. It is also found that social commerce can promote serendipity.",
    "context6": "Furthermore，the topics on serendipity have been broadly investigated in various aspects of research directions.The majority of the literature focuses on serendipity in science.Sauer et al.4]claimed that serendipity maybe more accurately regarded as a factor in science that influences diverse stages of the research process， and it contributes to scientific advancement.",
    "context7": "The objective of this paper is to understand and analyze the phenomena of serendipity，including the unsought discoveries during the research process，the specific peculiarities of serendipity in science，and the triggers for increasing the probabilities of making serendipitous discoveries. Accordingly，we summarize the problems pertaining to serendipity in the context of science. Serendipity is often associated with the exciting moment that describes the unexpected but distinguished scientific discoveries and the guidance to a new research direction."
  },
  "1.1 Motivation": {
    "context1": "Many accidental but valuable discoveries have been attributed to serendipity in the history of science. Serendipitous discovery denotes something that is not looking for directly，but is useful or valuable for the explorers indirectly，e.g.，the extraordinary discoveries of penicillin，the breakthrough of discovering X-rays,， and even the surprising discovery of America.The outcomes are diffrent from the original intentions of their discoverers.However，they are new clues produced by the initial projects，which help explorers making breakthroughs via further investigations.This natural proces in science may shed some light on the new research directions that have the potential to make several scientific breakthroughs[15]. Meanwhile，such discoveries can be regarded as serendipitous since they happened by accdent and had a positive efect on researchers. Many new ideas and interesting approaches usually emerge in a very unpredictable and serendipitous manner and this could be the atraction and motivation.In this case，serendipity is beneficial to scientific research and makes the research activities interesting simultaneously.",
    "context2": "Moreover,the serendipitous academic entities，including the serendipitous collaborators，scholarly papers, collaboration teams，and even the search engine which provides surprising results for users，are significant to the study.Nevertheless，most scholars have not recognized the existence of serendipity during their research process due to a lack of understanding."

  "1.2Contributions": {
    "context1": "One focus of this paper is on the understanding of the notion of serendipity in science. Although the concept of serendipity does not have a common definition in the literature,most existing research divides serendipity into diferent components.These components are novelty，diversity，and unexpectednes. Diferent combinations of these components have widely been used to define serendipity in various scenarios. Here we analyze these components of serendipity in the context of science and clarify the diferences between them.To accomplish these research aims，we colated serendipity-related articles by searching the term“serendipity”and serendipity-related components such as“novelty”，“diversity”,and“unexpectedness” in multiple academic repositories like Google Scholar and Web of Science. Special attention was given to serendipity in the fields of information retrieval and academic research.This survey helps readers in understanding the multi-faceted concepts，fruitful implications, and valuable applications of serendipity in science.",

  "2What is Serendipity?": {
    "context1": "In this section，we introduce the components of serendipity for its conceptual analysis and describe their specific forms in the context of science. Different understandings about the term serendipity are correspondingly proposed to explain it in multiple ways.Furthermore，serendipity has different forms under diffrent application scenarios.Therefore，we analyze the characteristics of serendipity and the role played by each of its related components in science for a better understanding."
  },
  "2.1Related Components of Serendipity": {
    "context1": "It is generally recognized that serendipity contains three main components，i.e.，novelty，diversity，and unexpectedness. Serendipity-related academic entities in science are usually formed as serendipity-related papers, collaborators，and collaborative teams[16]. In this case，related concepts of serendipity may be analyzed with respect to the corresponding characteristics of academic entities. We discuss each component detailedly in the following subsections.",
    "context2": "(1）Novelty: Numerous studies discovered that novelty has always been considered an essential factor in scientific research17-22. Stephan et al.[17] studied the characteristics of novel research，aiming at uncovering the interesting associations between impactful profiles and novelty. Moreover，the novel papers are defined to have the following characteristics :",
    "context3": "$\\textcircled{1}$ High risk:The risk normally exists in the citation distribution，which is dynamic and variant at different stages after publication.Moreover,the citation counts of novel papers usually occupy the smaller ratio of papers’ total citation counts.",
    "context4": "$\\textcircled{2}$ High gain:The novel papers are likely to be influential papers with the top number of citation counts in the future，and are also enable to support follow-on top-cited research.",
    "context5": "$\\textcircled{3}$ Interdisciplinary impact: The novel papers are supposed to have a characteristic of interdisciplinarity, which tends to reach more distant scientific fields.Additionall，novel research papers have a higherlikelihood of being cited in different fields than non-novel research papers.",
    "context6": "$\\textcircled{4}$ Delayed recognition: The novel papers generally achieve low citations in a short time after they are published. However, they willstart to attract attention at a certain time point since then.",
    "context7": "Bornman et al.[18]unpacked the concept of novelty as exploration of creativity in scientific teams.The factors that make a scientific team creative are also examined.Moreover，the efectiveness of team size on novelty is alsodiscussed,i.e.，“team size has an inverted-Urelationwith the novelty\".Herein,itisfoundthathe novelty increases with the growth ofscientific team size.The large size willincrease the diversity of knowledge in a team.The knowledge diversity of a team is likely to support the novel interactions as well as scientific discoveries. However，when the team size is over a certain threshold, the novelty will decrease.",
    "context8": "Moreover,the importance of sientific collaborations is deeply analyzed in abundant studies[9-21].Yu et al.19] studied Science of Scientific Team Science (SSTS）and summarized the key technologies in interdisciplinary research. Wang et al.[20]analyzed the influence of scholars’age on scientific collaboration.Itis found that senior scholars have more colaborators，the academic age distribution follows the long-tail distribution.Singh et al[21] suggested that single researchers are struggling because of the lack of assistance. Collaboration willincrease the diversity of the group since it contains diverse researchers with diffrent backgrounds and expertise.The diverse group may stimulate more novel combinations or interactions among group members.",
    "context9": "Novelty plays an important role in science，but it should also be valued reasonably. It is inadvisable to pay much attention to the value of novelty[23].An extreme case is that scientists tend to use the claim“the first to demonstrate/find/propose” to emphasize the novelty of their research. As a result，an increasing number of scientists neglect their rigorous research，which is the necessarily precondition of successful research.",
    "context10": "(2）Diversity:This is another component of serendipity，which increases the variety of research and broadens the horizons of researchers. Sometimes，diversity is also considered as the interdisciplinarity of scholars’research topics across different disciplines. Generally，the research projects with interdisciplinary backgrounds are usually more creative because the colaboration between scholars with diverse knowledge tends to stimulate their research in an inspirational way. Researchers in a team can acquire knowledge from other members who have different research themes[24].",
    "context11": "Consequently，diversity corrsponds to the characteristics of interdisciplinarity and also indicates the knowledge variety in science. Moirano et al.25]claimed that if researchers contact with other researchers who have diverse expertise，they are more likely to generate unpredictable and novel ideas. Therefore，scientists expect to collaborate with other scientists in different or crossing fields to gain relevant but different ideas or knowledge.",
    "context12": "In terms of interdisciplinarity，Rafols et al.[26] used diversity to catch the heterogeneity of bibliometrics. Disciplinary diversity denotes a wide variety of knowledge in science.Abramo etal.[7]outlined a framework for interdisciplinary analysis of diversity that recognizes the three properties of diversity，namely:variety，balance, and disparity.“Variety means the number of distinctivecategories，balance indicates the evennessofthe distribution ofcategories，and the disparity or similarity denotes the degree to which the categories are diferent/similar\".",
    "context13": "As for the term of team diversity，i.e.，a team containing a collection of scientists with diferent disciplines or country backgrounds,AlShebli et al.28]described that different research cultures make up the diverse academic research teams.And the research performance of a diverse team is associated with the extent of its diversity. It is found that the most successful teams have a moderate level of team diversity，i.e., $2 0 \\% { \\sim } 2 5 \\%$ of the team members are from disparate research disciplines or countries. Diverse team members may promote the knowledge production of the team，which increases the opportunities of encountering serendipity in their research. Moreover，the team members might show a willingness to master corresponding skills to seize the opportunities. However,too much diversity might decrease the productivity of a team as it might lead to disorder in a team[28].",
    "context14": "Zhou et al.[29] proposed two metrics，which are multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity. They described the multidisciplinarity degree of a team as“the diversity ofresearchers’institutional afiliations”，and defined the interdisciplinarity degree of a researcher’s scientific production as“the diversityof his/her articles in terms of the domains in which they have been published\". Meanwhile，they claimed that the multidisciplinary environment strongly supports individual interdisciplinarity during the personal research process，and these two metrics can be both maintained for supporting serendipity.",
    "context15": "(3） Unexpectednes: This is a crucial component of serendipity，which captures the kernel of serendipity. The unexpected discovery is unpredictable，which contributes to the occurrences of serendipity. Most researchers incline to make unexpected or distinguished statements in their papers for atracting others’atentions and laying emphasis on their findings.",
    "context16": "We tend to be interested in those scientific research papers with surprising findings； therefore，it seems that the unusual statements in a research paper determine its academic influence[30]. According to [31]，the odds of finding the statements such as “surprising”，“unexpectedness”，or“unusualness” in the abstract of a scientific paper are greater than that of non-scientific paper. It has been recognized by most researchers that the use of “surprising” or“unexpectedness” in the title or abstract in a paper makes the research results more prominent, thereby attracting readers’ atention. However， papers with the extensive usage of these words may not have received an enhanced number of citations[32-34]. Therefore，it is undesirable to emphasize these words since the quality of a paper is not determined by the wide usage of these words.The distribution of such unexpected statements is not used randomly in the literature(chemistry discipline has the most papers using these words[32l).",
    "context17": "We then introduce an unexpected phenomenon with respect to the dynamic citation distribution of a paper, which is considered as the sleeping beauty in science 31. A Sleeping Beauty (SB） in science is definedas“a paper whose mportance is not recognized for several years after publication\". Its citation has an unusual distribution trajectory，which experienced a long period of stagnation followed by a sudden awakening of rising. In the begining，such papers were referred by a few researchers. However，after a period of silence and citation accumulation，they stand out from those ordinary papers.These papers gain delayed recognitions with tremendous potential value and may surprise many researchers for their unusual citation trajectories. We regard this as serendipity-related for the awakening of Sleeping Beauty.",
    "context18": "Similarly，the serendipity-related academic entities play an indispensable role in the rise of their target entities in science，and they are worthy of being studied in-depth for valuable applications.For example，the technology of recommending serendipity-related scientific collaborators will increase the satisfaction of the targeted scholar. Therefore，it issignificant to generalize the characteristicsof serendipity-related scientific collaborators.",
    "context19": "(4） Difference between serendipity and its components: From the analysis of the three components, serendipity in science can be supported by various schemes.The novelty of a research team can be enhanced via appropriate collaboration team size.The interdisciplinary members of a team can promote team diversity. The unexpectedness of a research paper can be increased through its surprising findings or the unusual popularity trajectory. Novelty，diversity，and unexpectedness are not the unique and fixed components of serendipity. It should be noticed that serendipitous discoveries $D _ { s r d p }$ are not equivalent to the combination of novel discoveries $D _ { n o \\nu }$ ， diverse discoveries $D _ { d i v }$ ， and unexpected discoveries $D _ { u x p }$ ,i.e.,",
    "context20": "$$\nD _ { s r d p } \\neq D _ { n o \\nu } \\cap D _ { d i \\nu } \\cap D _ { u x p }\n$$",
    "context21": "Novelty，diversity，and unexpectedness may be the main components of serendipity. However,serendipity is not entirely determined by these three components. Generally,， none of these three elements are necessarily mandatory components of serendipity，since serendipity has different forms and different components might be emphasized under different scenarios.Besides，different combinations of three components can be adopted to define serendipity，i.e.，novelty and diversity，diversity and unexpectedness， novelty and unexpectedness，or the combination of three components. Based on previous literatures，serendipitous research shows uncommon clues to the researchers during the research process，and it may be noted for making surprising discoveries. Nonserendipitous research usually produces the outcomes that are within the expectations of researchers，and the citation counts also follow the normal developmental trajectory.",
    "context22": "Kotkov et al.2] suggested that relevance is a necessary component of serendipity in the context of the recommender system，and serendipity is equivalent to the combination of relevance，unexpectedness，and novelty. They have not considered other related components for complementing the concept of serendipity. Meanwhile，they denoted that diversity is incompatible with relevance，and hence diversity has no correlation with serendipity.In this survey，diversity associated with the characteristic of interdisciplinarity is regarded as a critical component of serendipity in science. It is also reasonable to take relevance as a necessary component of serendipity since relevance caters to the preferences of researchers and guarantees the serendipity within the scope of researchers’preferences.",
    "context23": "![](images/74d4350c5077a651418eb757bcf9c023fef364d10734399a14046facb195cbf5.jpg)  \nFig.2The Relationship Between Serendipity and its Components.",
    "context24": "Fig.2 shows the relationship between serendipity and the concepts mentioned above.The other components surrounding serendipity in this figure are available according to the specific scientific scenarios for complementing the definition of serendipity. Moreover，relevance is a necessary component of serendipity, which occupies a central position.In other words,researchers may select relevance and other several components among the available components for the complete definition of serendipity based on their application scenarios."

  "2.2Definition of Serendipity in Science": {
    "context1": "The origin of the term‘serendipity’and various common definitions are discussed in Section 1. In this section，we discuss the definitions of serendipity and summarize them according to the serendipity in science in Table 1.Herein，we list the factors or elements which are contained in corresponding definitions in the last column.",
    "context2": "In contrast to the definition given in[3],serendipity is not equivalent to chance.A chance may increase the opportunityof encountering serendipity，but it is not the determinant. Personal insight is alsoa crucial dimension for making serendipitous discoveries，and researchers need to be observant of what is going on during the exploration or experiment process.Besides，the outcome in accordance with the expectations of a target is not serendipitous， since it cannot surprise the target.",

    "context5": "Thereare many different understandings of serendipity corresponding to the diffrent scenarios[4,12,36-42]. Serendipity insience hasitsparticularcharacteristics that is dificult todiscover43]Thecorefactor is thetrigger that stimulates serendipity in the first place.The curiosity and observation are the basic triggers and necessary precursors for the serendipitous scientific discoveries[8].Accordingly,it is crucial to reward researchers’curiosity (whichis called“serendipity demands curiosity）and encourage them to explore new directions. Meanwhile,luck and skill are both important factors for making serendipitous discoveries.Copeland[43] proposed three associated characteristics of serendipity in science.First，the process of making serendipitous discoveries is complex with many uncertainties. Second，a valuable outcome is necessry for the significance of studying it. Third，the unexpectedness can be quantified by the expectedness due to the opposite meaning of the two terms. According to [14]，the challenge of modeling serendipity with respect to science is to provide researchers knowledge or experiences，which are not only relevant but also able to change their conventional way of thinking.",
    "context6": "Serendipitous discoveries in different scientific research have different characteristics and patterns. There are quite many previous literatures implement complete analyses of influencing factors of serendipity. Many factors that influence serendipity in science，and existing research has shown that individual diferences，temporary states，environmental characteristics，and prepared mind may affect it41. McCay-Peet etal.38] explored the main factors which related to individuals and their environment may promote serendipity.These factors include four external or environmental factors （trigger-rich，highlights triggers，enables connections，and enables capturing.） and three internal factors related to individuals (openness，prepared mind，and ability to make connections.).",
    "context7": "Yaqubl44 identify four types of serendipity: targeted search solves the unexpected problem （Walpolian serendipity），targeted search solves problem-in-hand via the unexpected route（Mertonian serendipity）, untargeted search solves an immediate problem （Bushian serendipity），and untargeted search solves a later problem(Stephanian serendipity). Meanwhile，four mechanisms of serendipity are also introduced，including Theory-led，Observer-led，Error-borne，and Network-emergent.It is found that different forms of serendipity could have different implications for policy and theory.",
    "context8": "These four categories of serendipitous discoveries are not mutually exclusive. Meanwhile， the four categories have no clear boundaries.It is crucial to find the mechanism behind the serendipitous discoveries.The following four recurring mechanisms from a large number of case comparisons are also listed in the abovementioned work :",
    "context9": "(1）Theory-led serendipity mechanism: the development of scientific theory helps researchers observing serendipity naturally. (2）Observer-led serendipity mechanism: the observers may only find serendipity with specific tools, techniques，or features. （3）Error-borne serendipity mechanism: serendipity may emerge following methodological deviations, errors，, and spillages. (4） Network-emergent serendipity mechanism: serendipity may also emerge in a network of researchers with different skills and resources.",
    "context10": "Therefore，serendipity is closely related to policies and cultures such as interdisciplinarity，personal orientation,tolerance，and teamwork.",
    "context11": "Serendipity is a substantial factor that many scholars have incorporated into their information-seeking behaviors. Zhuang et al.[45|provided the reasons for accepting serendipity: firstly，serendipity is an essential part of science and acts in connection with other factors with flexibly,in order to“achieve a more in-depth research project\". Secondly,the opportunities to encounter serendipity during the research should be strongly encouraged, since the serendipitous discoveries are more likely to become the breakthroughs in science.",
    "context12": "However，serendipity is not treated fairly and critically by everyone. Some people exaggerate serendipity for the attractive clue and surprising outcome，while others suppress serendipity for its unpredictable emergence and uncontrollable process Apparently，serendipity in science usually bonds with accident，error，chance，luck，or purely limited perceptions. Therefore,it is always recognized as unexpected results， which runs against research targets.For those scholars who achieve such results might need to have the extensive sights and forward-looking views cross disciplines. It would be quite a difficult work for a solo scholar. However，by cross disciplinary collaboration，scholars may discover serendipitous output with higher probability.This is because that the development of information technology，researchers can easily obtain relevant but different knowledge through interdisciplinary collaboration.Existing studies have proved that researchers may develop new ways of thinking or get unexpected knowledge when they interacting with other researchers with different professional fields and backgrounds.Moreover，due to the different research policies in different disciplines，the distribution of coincidences in various research fields may be uneven. In emerging research fields，serendipitous discoveries are more common. Highly empirical research fields in natural sciences (such as astronomy，organic chemistry, medicine,and technology） may have discoveries that are not found in social sciences [94]."

  "3Tools for Exploring Serendipity": {
    "context1": "Serendipity continuously contributes to science，which has drawn scholars’attention. Meanwhile，scholars have rcognized the need to provide support for serendipity in science.It is meaningful for researchers to investigate how to support or expand serendipity in research activities. Researchers have developed various tools and technologies to investigate the factors thattrigger the occurrences of serendipitous phenomenon[4649l in order to stimulate serendipity. Cremonini[46] showed the posibility of creating a more serendipitous environment for users.By supporting the users to make discoveries in a diffrent manner and keeping them at the center of interaction simultaneously，the serendipitous environment is setup.Liu et al.[s0]constructed a web of scholars based on the knowledge graph，which provides inteligent semantic query and recommendation services. In the process of using it，we can obtain some unexpected knowledge.It is also verified that serendipitous experiences can be marked by verbal and textual triggers in scientific research[14l.For example，the verbal trigger is that a scientist interacts with a collague via oral language，while the communication between scientists with a message in a digital or paper-based source belongs to the textual trigger. Aditionally，the effects of serendipity are not always instant. The triggers may not immediately take efect，and a period of incubation is sometimes necessary. According to [38]，most serendipitous results are caused by latent triggers.",
    "context2": "Various technologies integrating serendipity have been mainly developed for three tools，including search engines，micro-blogging，and recommender systems.In this section，we summarize some important technologies behindthese three widely used tools supporting serendipity (the corresponding references are given in Table 2).",

  "3.1Serendipity in Search Engines": {
    "context1": "Computer scientists have considered serendipity as an indispensable factor for both creativity and innovation in science.They have designed various systematic applications or systematic tools integrating serendipity[52-54]. Search engines are widely used tools for scholars’research activities[641. Researchers acquire information through the search results，and the search engine will show the relevant content once people input the phrases or queries[6s-6]. Generally,this kind ofsearch tool may be“critical”for its high relevance with the search contents. Researchers have dificulties in finding serendipitous information from the search engines providing highly relevant search contents.",
    "context2": "When browsing the web，users often discover interesting information accidentally and then click the links which they had not intended to query for. Searching results with interesting results as wellas lowrelevance enable to stimulate serendipity. Generally，serendipitous search results cannot match the problem posed directly，but they are useful and surprising. Tsurel et al.[67] explored the potential to encounter serendipitous results when they were searching on the web，and suggested that personal interest and behavioral information may be utilized to stimulate serendipity while searching on the web.They investigated the search results that people rated as ‘most interesting and relevant’ simultaneously and hypothetically that‘most interesting but not highly relevant’results"
