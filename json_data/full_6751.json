    "context2": "Due to the exponential increase of information and the urgent need for ways to cope with it, recommender systems are an exciting field of study,since they provide a way of dealing with certain information management needs.Recommender systems are hugely popular in E-commerce applications,and consequently most current research is geared towards addressing mainly\" industrial strength 'applications.At their most basic, recommender systems enhance informationretrieval systems through improvingalgorithms and implicit user profiling enhancement,adding knowledge based recomendations or adding context sensitivity,and using bots or agentsasdiscovery tools.",
    "context3": "Personalization and recommender systems have been discretely appliedtodigital libraries,buttherearesignificantobstaclestoovercome in order to realize the vision and potential of a recommender systemthatcouldbeappliedacrossdistributeddigital libraryresources. A recommender system is an automatic electronic system that replicatesthereal-timeactivitiesofaReader sAdvisoryServices librarian. However,the nature of recommender systems in collecting personal data is at ods with the traditional nature of libraries to destroy personal data to protect patron privacy.Will the social benefits of sharing and collaborating personal preference information make patrons willing to compromise onprivacy? Can the flexibility required byusersdiverse information needs bepracticallybuilt into future systems? These study questions need further exploration."
  },
  "1 Background and Development": {
    "context1": "Originating asa function called‘ collaborative filtering \" recommender systems appear to have been first developed through the\" Tapestry Project 'at Xerox Parc (currently the Palo Alto Research Center).This project al lowed users to comment on articles they read with the term\" Likeit ’or\" hateit \" Another project, entitled\" GroupLens \" continued the development of this function, which was begun as the result of the increasing popularity of bulletin board posts on Netnews,the newsgroup of the most widely distributed internet news service called USENET.This proliferation of information required a way to sort out what a user was most interested in fromall the other information,through combining the collaborativefilteringprocesswithuserprofileswhichwouldal low a comparison between previous user s likes and dislikes and a current user 's needsbasedon similarities in profile[1].",
    "context2": "In the advent of the World Wide Web and internet-based marketing, merchants are faced with the necessity of developing successful methods of substituting face-to-face human judgment and recommendations when promoting the sale of their products.In addition, theonlineclient isnowfacedwithseeminglyendlesschoices and the information overload from such choices can be overwhelming. Computer-based recommender systems have been designed in order to address these two complementary needs. While these systems have been primarily developed for marketing purposes, they also have the potential to serve librarypatrons in their search for online resourcesusingdigital librariesandcomputer-basedsearchengines.",
    "context3": "We are heading towards a time when it will be routine for computer applications to draw upon and integrate content from numerousdigital librariesand touse long-termuserhistories tohelp personalize this material.These systems are begining to emerge, butthedifficultyof integrating material frommultiplesources and utilizing long-termuserhistory foreffective personalization is a scienceinitsinfancy.Digitallibrariesthatexplicitlytailordelivered information for specificuseswill simplifysuch integration as well as support new types of applications. Lifelong learning services will takeaspecific informationneed, interpret itwithinthecontext of a person’s user model as it changes over time,and create a personalizedlearningplanthatspansmultipledigital libraries."
  },
  "2Design and Technology of Recommender Systems": {
    "context1": "Is it possible to imitate human judgment using a computerized informationretrieval system? Users expect search engines todeliver answers to their queries, no matter how idiosyncraticor imprecise the formulation of their search.\" Recommender systems support usersby identifying interestingproductsandservices insituations where the number and complexity of offers outstrips the users capability to survey them and reach a decision 2].",
    "context2": "There exist six important software processes which attempt to weave human judgment into a computational process, with as littleexplicit humaneffort as possible.Theyareas fol lows:"
  },
  "2.1 Cluster Analysis": {
    "context1": "Clusteranalysis is a mathematical process which identifies groups of objects which have similar attributes when the attributes are otherwise unknown.For the purposes of marketing,the theory behind the usefulness of cluster analysis is that consumers who have similar demographics and/or lifestyles will have simi lar purchasing habits and preferences.The weakness of cluster analysis is that it tends to result in a construct of very few groups and as a result does not have high accuracy and then usefulness for one-toonemarketing[3] ."
  },
  "2.2Collaborative Filtering": {
    "context1": "Col laborative Filtering is the most successful e-commerce technology for recommender systems. Collaborative filtering attempts to resolve the problem of substituting human judgment with computer technology by identifying customers with simi lar purchasing choices to the target customer.The system then makes recommendations to the target customer based on the purchases made by other consumers who have purchased the same items that the target customer has purchased in the past.A familiar example of acol laborative filtering system is the system popularizedby Amazon. com[4]."
  },
  "2.3CRM": {
    "context1": "Customer Relationship Management(CRM) is a strategy to collect, store and analyze data from existing customers in order to analyze customer behavior and plan targeted marketing strategies. The focus is on existing customers and on using customer data for targeting. Quatsel3] notes that using CRM for one-to-one marketing is not simple or efficient because with CRM, the\" human judgment issue is resolved bya human operator, typicallyan IT professional or specialist at the task, who passes judgment on which group of customers might be the most likely targets for each promotional offer.'Therefore, the process is not solely driven by computer technologies,but requireshuman intervention,andasignificant investment of time and human resources."
  },
  "2.4Statistical Inference": {
    "context1": "Statistical Inference is a recommender system based on consumer behavior in physical stores and takes into consideration the differences between e-commerce and brick andmortar stores.In this system,“ a model of each customer is based upon the statistics of previous purchases and the probability of a future purchase is inferred from the model.\"lThemajordifference in the design concept is that the Statistical Inference system is designedaround consumableitems whichare repeatedlypurchased (toothpaste,toilet paper, bananas, etc.) as opposed to the type of items one would typically purchase from a vendor such as Amazon.com, which are likely to be aonetime purchaseof aparticularbookor CD, for example.Therefore, the Statistical Inference system focuses on the repeated purchases of aparticular consumer,as opposed to thesimi larities in purchases among different consumers.The system is clearly more useful for physical storesthan fortypical onlinetransactions."
  },
  "2.5Social Data Mining": {
    "context1": "Social Data Miningdescribes mined preferences from the World Wide Web analyzing social online activity such as Usenet messages, usage logs and hyperlinks.Information is extracted and used to designand transmit information, which isusually transmitted viaa broadcast to a group as opposed to direct targeting toan individual consumer. With this process, the intended audience will receive the recommender broadcast whether or not he is expecting or intentionallyseeking recommendations[5]."
  },
  "2.6Social Networking": {
    "context1": "Social networking acts as informal recommender systems amongst users who\" tag'their favorite websites. Users can search the site by keyword and see lists of different websites that have been\" tagged 'by their peers.Instead of having bookmarks on your personal computer they can be kept at the site where you and others can access them.Aperson only needs access to the net to find their favorite websites and learn about others that are popular as well."
  },
  "2.7Cross System Personalization": {
    "context1": "Cross System Personalization isa relatively recent development in the field of recommender systems and personalization, which allows the user limited control over information built up and mustalso be repeated for everywebsite in some fashion.The initial thought was to create a user passport that could be carried and presented from one system to the next, but that would require systems having some sort of global ly accepted semantics.A later idea involved the use of machine learning techniques which would eliminate the need for globally accepted semantics.The key idea is that one can try to learn dependencies between profiles maintained within one system and profiles maintained within a second system based on data provided by users who use both systems and who are willing to share their profiles across systems which we assume is in the interestof theuser[6]."
  },
  "2.8 Recommender Support System": {
    "context1": "Recommender Support System does not automate the process of making a recommendation,but rather provides tools to permit individuals to share recommendations with others.This type of system is also used by Amazon.com where users are invited to createannotated listsof recommendations usinga feature referred to as‘ Listmania.5]",
    "context2": "All of these technological systems are designed with the goal of replacing normal human social interaction with effective computer intervention in order to create and communicate meaningful recommendations toa target audience."
  },
  "3Application of Recommender Systems to Digital Libraries": {
    "context1": "The needs of digital library users and library patrons who use online library services parallel the needs and activities of onl ine consumers in that there isa clear need for aviable substitute for human judgment and human-mediated recommendations in a digital world where the patrons'ability to formulate a search query is unknown to the host and the potential for information overload to theuser ispervasive.",
    "context2": "“ As digital libraries become commonplace,as their contents and services become more varied and as their patrons become more experienced with computer technology, people expect more sophisticatedservices fromtheirdigital libraries '],Duetotheproblemsof information overload and qualityassessment, users rely heavi lyon their peers for recommendations in order to save valuable time in conducting research. Recommender systems are a promising tool for librariestoassistpatrons inefficient informationseekinginlightof information overload and the problem of quality assessment.",
    "context3": "TheStanfordDigitalLibraryProject,http://dbpubs.stanford. edu:8091/index.shtml, uses a combination of the content-based and collaborative filtering recommendersystemsand createsusageprofiles forusergroupswithsimi lar interests.\"] Inaddition,according to the information availableon its website,the Stanford project is currentlydeveloping techniques forclustering analysisof the World Wide Web.",
    "context4": "The Melvyl Recommender Project at the University of Californiaat BerkeleyDigital Libraryallows patrons tobuildpersonalized digital collectionsof documents[8].The purpose of this Melvyl Recommender Project is to providé feasibilityof closing the gap between features that library patrons want and have come to expect from information retrieval systems and what libraries are equipped todeliver.\"] Theapplicationto librariesofseveral technologiesto which information seekers have become accustomed includes the use of a text-based discovery system, spelling correction, user interfaces,relevance ranking and recommender systems.Two recommender system methods employed through this project are thecollaborative filteringmethodbasedoncirculationdata,and the content-based method which analyzes the content ofbibliographic metadata for the target item, chooses the most important terms in the record,and formulates a new query for the patron[10].",
    "context5": "The Melvyl researchersalso examinedusers attitudes toward recommendations in both the commercial sector and the library environment. Users had varying attitudes toward commercial recommendations which included concerns about tracking and privacy, concerns about not having time to peruse additional items,and indications that they did not use recommendations because they already knew what they wanted when they made the decision to shop online[9].",
    "context6": "Interestingly,whenquestionedaboutattitudesconcerningrecommendations in the library catalog,as opposed to the commercial sector, the majorityof the subjects indicated that they would use a recommendation feature for academic work.Unlike the commercial sector, none of the subjects indicated that they would not use the feature.It isclear from thisstudy that librarypatrons find recommendations usefulandhelpful,and that patrons are familiarwith the technological possibilitiesandhave become accustomed to their use.",
    "context7": "The Polar Bear Expedition Digital Library not only has‘ Link paths that show you what others interested in your viewing also viewed,but allows comments to be posted about the contents - an interestingresource[11].",
    "context8": "The use of recommender systems for digital libraries now mostly centers on the personalization of information and services. Digital libraries ought to become more proactive in personalizing and tailoring information to theirusers,in fact, Callan notes that “ digital libraries that arenotpersonalized for individualsand/or communitieswill beseenas defaultingon theirobligation tooffer the best service possible.lRecommender systems are sometimes touted asthe\" librarians 'indigitalenvironments.Infact,itmightbehoove libraries to put chat reference links in places where patrons have difficultyfindinginformation,especiallyinsituationswhenthesearch list inadatabase is too large or too small."

  "4 Issues Using Recommender Systems in the Library Environment": {
    "context1": "It is clear that Internet commerce has exposed users to the technological advantages of recommender systems and has created a certain expectation in users for recommender systems.While there are clear benefits to developing recommender systems for digital librariesandotheronline libraryservices, thereareseveral issues unique to the library environment which library professionals must consider in pursuing the development of recommender systems for l ibraryuse.",
    "context2": "Although it wouldbeanovel feature to haveadigitallibrary “ feedpatrons information about new items based on previous searches certain problems need attention.There are issues, important to librarians, when considering the development of recommender systems indigital libraries,suchasdatasize,budgetrestrictionsand privacy,among others.",
    "context3": "The data sizecan be abarrier that makes adatabase system too difficult to categorize the relationship between the content of the objects and the access and use of the objects and to create recognizable associations between them. Geyer-Schulz, et al[8] explain the issues concerning data size as follows: The number of documents contained in many publicor academic library systems isat least one orderof magnitude higher than in most commercial organizations.",
    "context4": "This implies thattransaction level data isscatteredonmoredocuments. While one would expect that more data implies a better chance for findingmeaningful patterns,itbecomes increasinglydifficult todetect these patterns due to their sparsity,and because the computational complexcityof counting suchassociation rules isexponential in the number of objects.8]2",
    "context5": "The budget restrictionsusually impose limits of using the recommendersystems indigital libraries.Librarybudgets,particularly thoseof public libraries,are notoriouslytightanywhere,and the investment in the necessary technology for the development and maintenance of recommender systems for digital libraries and for libraryservices may be prohibitive.Although the cost of implementation is a problem, as time goes by, these technologies will undoubtedlybecomemoreaffordable.Itthereforebenefits librariesto consider what adjustments should be made to recommender systems to best fit the library environment.",
    "context6": "The privacy issue is perhaps the most disconcerting in the use of recommender systems indigital libraries.Librariansaremindful of the privacy concerns of their patrons and cautions that quote transaction-level dataaswellas readinghistoriesmustbeprotected. Privacy inthecontextof recommender systems fordigital libraries is a central and complex challenge for digital library research is the balancebetweenprivacyandcollaboration[7].Particularlyintheacademiclibraryarenait isdesirablefordigital librariestofacilitate communication, the sharing of ideas and resources,and collaboration in research efforts.Privacy concerns can be addressed to some extent by offering users anonymous accounts,and by offering features which permit the user to opt out of recommender services. The convenience of the Internet has encouraged individuals to voluntarily relinquisha certain level of privacy.The convenience and benefits of recommender systems for digital libraries and library serviceswill likewise encourage patrons to relax theirstandardson protecting their own personal privacy[12].",
    "context7": "There is not a shortage of areas for recommender research; hot areas are algorithms, metrics for recommender system performance, modeling of usersand tasks,etc.but there isashortage of systems to use as a testing ground. An important research need is a large shared infrastructure of software, content,and committed users with which to test and evaluate systems.",
    "context8": "The current research seems to have two overarching, fundamental elements.The first is concernedwith gaining abetter understanding of how people seek advice and consider recommendations, whereas the second aims to apply those findings in a recommender system test bed permitting in vivo experiments and user studies. The overall goal is to investigate the effects of the quality of recommendations,theeffectiveelements indecision-making and how these can be incorporated into useful recommender systems. Furthermore, the social elements in user matching and recommendationgenerationthroughcollaborativefilteringsuggest interesting research potential for the integrationof recommender systems and socialnetworkingfunctionality[11].",
    "context9": "Three specific devices of applied system recommenders being investigatedare:",
    "context10": "● Algorithms: Different typesof complex mathematical algorithms are used on the data based upon the requirements of the recommender. Many aspects of recommender algorithms are being studied,includingtheoriginalcollaborativefilteringalgorithms.Nearly all user interfaceandapplicationsresearch involvesdevelopingnovel algorithms and testing theireffectiveness.Alsostudied are the effects of agents inalgorithms. Agents complement recommender systems by providing a tireless source of rapid and reliable opinions. Recommender systems complement agents by choosing the agents that are the best recommender for each user.",
    "context11": "· User Interfaces: Many aspects of the user interface affect recommenders,including experimentsonuserpreferences fordifferent types of explanations of the recommendations being explored. Experiments on the best ways for recommender systems to get to know new users,and experiments on the effect on the user experience of having the recommender manipulate the predictions maliciously are the main focus of the work being conducted at the Uni - versity of Minnesota; a leader in the field of investigation of recommender system technology.",
    "context12": "● Applications: Application research typicallyrequires new algorithms, new interfaces,and research on what happens when users use the newalgorithms and interfaces in practice. Research is ongoing into incorporating using user contexts into algorithms to improving recommender performance,such as integrating metrics of interests (e.g.,click behavior, ranking) into the strategy of recommendation, or,making recommender systems available for mobile computing devices such as IngentaConnect担 MCORE product, which endorses certain types of information marketing to users based upon their context, such as their location, or what they areusingwith their mobiledevices[13].",
    "context13": "Other pertinent recommender systems research questions that invitefurtherexplorationinclude:",
    "context14": "● How far can recommender systems and social networking   \napplications (like Friendster or Orkut) benefit from each other in   \norder to increaseconsistent userparticipationandcontribution? ● Can the introduction of social networking aspects such as   \nexisting networks of friends (or recommenders) increase trust in",
    "context15": "recommender systems?",
    "context16": "● Can user matching via collaborative filtering encourage communication among like-minded users? ● Whatkindof metricscancollaborative filteringalgorithms contribute not only to the computation of recommendations, but also toeffectiveusermatching? · Is it possible to alleviate the cold start problem through explicit specificationof ones'closest neighbors?"

  "5Conclusion": {
    "context1": "Recommender systems today are increasingly a necessity as the burden of overly abundant information becomes heavier,and become a part of a complex process- personalization.There has been aproliferationof digital librariesandweb resource centers that not only recommend what to watch, read or buy, based on your profile and others of similar profile,but also want to\" know 'you, their clients, in order to provide more\" personalized service.The success of adopting the recommender systems ultimately depends on its efficacy in mapping user interests and feedback, continuous interactivesupport received frombeneficiaries to sustainand improve its performance,and a large electronic resource base to work with.",
    "context2": "Implementations of recommender systems indigital libraries relies heavily on the collaboration of professionals in various disciplines, including information, libraryandcomputerscience,to ensure the greatest benefit for individuals while at the same time allowing them to manage the increasing amounts of data on the net without sacrificing their privacy.The public has become accustomed to the service and usefulness of recommender systems in ecommerce and in Internet searching and will likely appreciate and benefit from an application of this technology to library services. This topic stands at an interesting intersectionof technology, patronservices and the social andprofessional issues currently facing librarians."
